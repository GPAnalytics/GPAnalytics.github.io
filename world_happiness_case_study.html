            <h2>Purpose and Context</h2>
            <p>This project, part of my CareerFoundry Data Analytics Course, aimed to
                demonstrate practical skills in data sourcing, analysis, and visualization, focusing on the World
                Happiness Report. Aligned with the course's objective of independent dataset selection, the
                project utilized Python for exploratory visual analysis, hypothesis development, and advanced
                analytics. The culmination was a concise Tableau storyboard presentation, showcasing a deep
                understanding of the data and its implications.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The World Happiness Report, published by the
            Sustainable Development Solutions Network, ranks
            countries annually based on life evaluations from
            Gallup World Poll data. Life evaluations, measured on
            the Cantril ladder (0 to 10), consider variables like
            GDP per capita, social support, healthy life
            expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption. This
            report is a global reference, sparking international
            conversations on well-being in policy-making</p>

<!-- Section 5: Steps -->
<div class="section" id="section-steps">
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <!-- Subsection 1 -->
    <h4>1. Cleaning and Merging Data</h4>
    <p>I began with nine datasets for the World Happiness Report (spanning 2015-2023),
        each representing a specific year. Utilizing a classic methodology, I merged these
        datasets, ensuring consistent formatting, addressing missing values, and eliminating
        duplicates for accurate and reliable data crucial to analysis.
    </p>

    <!-- Subsection 2 -->
<h4>2. Exploring Relationships</h4>
<p>Conducting EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) in Python involved tasks like
    correlation maps, scatter plots, and pair plots. A notable finding was the highest
    correlation between happiness score and GDP per Capita, leading to the hypothesis
    that higher GDP per Capita is associated with higher happiness scores. In order
    to further investigate this, advanced analytical methods, including regression
    analysis and k-means clustering, were performed to test and explore these
    connections.

    <!-- Subsection 3 -->
    <h4>3. Employing Advanced Analytical Methods</h4>

    <!-- Sub-subsection 3.1 -->
    <h5>Regression Analysis</h5>
    <p>Regression analysis helps us understand how one or more factors are related to an
        outcome, allowing us to predict or explain changes in the outcome based on the
        values of the factors. The results of the regression analysis were showing that our
        model moderately explains happiness score variability. Yet, nearly half the variance
        remains unexplained by GDP Per Capita.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- Sub-subsection 3.2 -->
    <h5>Cluster Analysis</h5>
    <p>A cluster analysis groups data points into "clusters". We can then compare the
        groups of data to uncover new patterns. Utilizing clustering, three distinct groups
        emerged. Analyzing the chart below, it's evident that countries in the Cluster 0 not
        only boast the highest median Happiness scores but also lead in GDP Per Capita.

    </div>
    <!-- Subsection 4 -->
    <h4>4. Spatial Exploration</h4>
    <p>Integrating a shapefile for spatial representation, I delved into geographic insights
        regarding the relationship between GDP per Capita and happiness scores. The
        results supported the hypothesis, confirming that regions with higher GDP were
        associated with elevated happiness scores.

        <!-- Section 6: Challenges -->
<div class="section" id="section-challenges">
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h5>Understanding the Kaggle Dataset</h5>
            <p>Understanding the Kaggle dataset posed initial challenges, particularly in interpreting terms
                like Corruption Perceptions. A notable anomaly emerged as countries with the highest
                happiness scores and elevated values in other variables exhibited unexpectedly high
                corruption values. To resolve this inconsistency, I conducted a thorough verification
                process using the World Happiness Report's official pageâ€”the dataset's primary source.
                The investigation clarified that variables represented contributions to the Happiness Score,
                not absolute measures. In the case of Corruption Perceptions, higher values indicated a lack
                of corruption, contributing positively to happiness in countries with higher happiness
                scores</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Project Time Constraints</h5>
            <p>The project encountered challenges in navigating the vast possibilities within the data.
                Despite the desire to delve deeper into regional aspects and variations, time constraints
                mandated a focused approach.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

        <!-- Section 7: Final Words -->
<div class="section" id="section-final-words">
    <h2>Final Words</h2>
    <p>In the World Happiness Report project, my journey through the realms of data analytics was
        both enlightening and with surprises.</p>
    <p class="mb-4"><!-- Add space between the lines --></p>
    <p>What surprised me was the nuanced relationship between happiness and GDP per capita.
        Initially, I expected a linear correlation, assuming that higher GDP per capita would consistently
        translate to higher happiness scores. However, the data challenged this assumption, revealing
        that the happiest countries don't consistently possess the highest GDP per capita. This
        unexpected finding underscores the complexity of factors influencing happiness.</p>
    <p class="mb-4"><!-- Add space between the lines --></p>
    <p>The unexpected revelation was the profound versatility of Python, not only as a tool for
        visualization but as a robust platform for advanced analytics, embracing methods like
        regression analysis and k-means clustering. The experience enriched my understanding of data
        analytics, teaching me to navigate challenges, validate hypotheses, and communicate findings
        effectively through Tableau.</p>

        <!-- Section 9: Summary -->
<div class="section" id="section-summary">
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Moving forward, a multivariate exploration, employing techniques such as multiple regression,
        will provide a nuanced understanding of how combinations of these factors interact to
        influence happiness, ensuring a comprehensive analysis beyond GDP per Capita alone.</p>
    <p class="mb-4"><!-- Add space between the lines --></p>
    <p>Exploring residual factors, with a focus on cultural, environmental, and political variables, to
        uncover additional influences on happiness beyond the primary variables considered in the
        World Happiness Report.</p>
